# Extant Project
The Extant Project is an ARG I am working on with some friends, telling a story of a fictional company known as Extant through the medium of a website, which is built with Sidebase, a framework built upon NuxtJS, which itself is based on VueJS.

You can download and run this project just like any other project of its kind, but copying the repo locally and running npm run dev, or npm run build.
